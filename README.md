To build this game from source, you will need:

 * The Processing Development Environment v1.5.1, from <http://processing.org/>
 * My patched version of the Fisica library for Processing v10, from <https://github.com/fadookie/fisica/downloads> (this is also included if you build Fisica from the latest development sources.)

Extract Fisica under /Path/To/ProcessingSketches/libraries
or inside of this folder under "libraries"

Open Sumogons.pde in Processing and hit the run button!
